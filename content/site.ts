  narratives: {
    groom: `Ced is currently putting his heart into writing the story of how he first met Ms. Kim—a memory that continues to make him smile every time he thinks about it. He wants to capture every detail just right: the moment their paths crossed, the first sparks of connection, and the unexpected feeling that something special had just begun.

He believes that their love story deserves to be told in the most genuine and meaningful way. That’s why he’s taking his time to compose it—choosing each word carefully, reliving the beautiful beginnings, and making sure the story reflects the depth of their relationship. Ced wants this narrative to feel as warm and timeless as the journey they’ve shared.

While the full story is still in the making, we invite you to revisit this page from time to time. Updates will be posted as soon as Ced finishes crafting the full narrative. Trust us—this is a story worth waiting for, and he can’t wait to share it with all of you.

Coming soon.`,
    bride: `Kim is lovingly preparing her own version of the story—how she first met Ced, how their connection began, and how everything slowly fell into place. She wants to share those first impressions, the moments that made her heart take notice, and the quiet certainty she felt as their relationship grew.

She believes their love story deserves to be told with sincerity and warmth. That’s why she’s taking her time, choosing words that genuinely capture her emotions, the memories she cherishes, and the journey that brought them to where they are today. For Kim, this story isn’t just about how they met—it’s about how love found its way naturally and beautifully into their lives.

While her full story is still being written, we encourage you to keep checking this page for updates. She’s excited to share her perspective soon, and she hopes it brings smiles, kilig, and a deeper look into the beginning of their forever.

Coming soon.`,
